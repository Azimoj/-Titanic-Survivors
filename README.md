# Titanic Survivors

Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters. Though there were about 2,224 passengers and crew members, we are given data of about 1,300 passengers. Out of these 1,300 passengers details, about 9000 data is used for training purpose and remaining 400 is used for test purpose. In this program we have to use different machine learning algorithms to predict whether the passengers in the test data survived or not.

Pclass : A proxy for socio-economic status (SES) 1st = Upper 2nd = Middle 3rd = Lower
sibsp : The # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister Spouse =
husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
